A Node.js version of MySQL Service Broker for Cloud Foundry!
===================

Overview
-------------

This is a Node.js version of MySQL Service Broker for Cloud Foundry which can be deployed as a Node.js application to Cloud Foundry or anywhere the node.js framework works.

The specification complies with the [Service Broker API v2](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/api.html). Some other official documents of Cloud Foundry - [Managing Service Brokers](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/managing-service-brokers.html#make-plans-public) & [Access Control](http://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/access-control.html) - were also be referenced.

Appreciate the original Java example which can be found [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-mysql-java-broker).

----------
Why creating an example with Node.js for a MySQL Service Broker?
-------------
 1. Already a lot of Service Broker examples in Java and Ruby - some people might be looking for something different. Hope this one can be used as a template for beginners like myself.
 2. MySQL Community Edition can be easily found and installed on Windows, Mac OS X or Linux and monitored with a good GUI admin tool called MySQL Workbench - easy for local environment test.
 3. Trust Microservices in Node.js fits this kind of task better.
 4. I am a database engineer without too much javascript experience and happen to notice that Node.js is so powerful and make applications and services easy to compose.

----------
Architecture
-------------
###Cloud Foundry Service Broker API v2
The broker can be deployed to any place where both sides - Cloud Foundry and MySQL Server - can be reached.

----------
Local Environment Test
-------------

Starting with a local MySQL server. Go to http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/ and download and install the proper release for your OS. 

I also prefer to use [MySQL Workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/) for GUI management but it is optional.

Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/komushi/cf-mysql-node-broker
cd cf-mysql-node-broker
```

Open cf-mysql-node-broker/server/app.js and **uncomment** the following lines. Hope they match your **default** settings.

    // process.env['host'] = "localhost";
    // process.env['port'] = "3306";
    // process.env['user'] = "root";
    // process.env['password'] = "";

Remeber to install [node.js and npm](http://nodejs.org/) first. Then, install the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then, run the Application:
```
npm start
```

You should be able access your app at with test/test as credentials. I just decided to use the basic authentication to make the code simple.
```
http://localhost:9000/v2/
```

Let's test the Microservices now.

```
curl -i -X GET http://test:test@localhost:9000/v2/catalog
```

```
curl -i -X PUT http://test:test@localhost:9000/v2/service_instances/myinstance
```

Check your MySQL server, now you should have a MySQL schema called **myinstance**.

```
curl -i http://test:test@localhost:9000/v2/service_instances/myinstance/service_bindings/mybindingid -d '{
"plan_id": "plan-guid-here",
"service_id": "service-guid-here",
"app_guid": "app-guid-here"
}' -X PUT
```

> access-control-allow-methods: GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS
> access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization,

Check your MySQL server, now you should have a user which has privileges of the schema **myinstance**. Remember the user name is generated by the binding id named **mybindingid**.

```
curl -i 'http://test:test@localhost:9000/v2/service_instances/myinstance/service_bindings/mybindingid?service_id=service-id-here&plan_id=plan-id-here' -X DELETE
```

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK X-Powered-By: Express access-control-allow-origin: *
> access-control-allow-methods: GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS
> access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization,
> Content-Length, X-Requested-With content-type: application/json
> content-length: 2 Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2015 09:55:49 GMT Connection:

> 
> {}

Check your MySQL server, the user is gone.

```
curl -i -X DELETE http://test:test@localhost:9000/v2/service_instances/myinstance
```

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK X-Powered-By: Express access-control-allow-origin: *
> access-control-allow-methods: GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS
> access-control-allow-headers: Content-Type, Authorization,
> Content-Length, X-Requested-With content-type: application/json
> content-length: 2 Date: Fri, 20 Feb 2015 09:58:57 GMT Connection:
> keep-alive
> 
> {}

This time the schema **myinstance** is also gone.

----------
Deployment to Cloud Foundry
-------------
If you are confident enough about this example you can skip the local test and deploy it to a web server which supports Node.js.

Clone this repository,
```
git clone https://github.com/komushi/cf-mysql-node-broker
cd cf-mysql-node-broker
```

Remember to install [cf cli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/releases) first. Then, push the application:
```
cf push
```

You can access your app at test/test as credentials.
```
http://cf-mysql-node-broker.<your-cf-app-domain>/v2
```

Create Service Broker with admin access.
```
cf create-service-broker mysqlbroker test test http://cf-mysql-node-broker.<your-cf-app-domain>
```
Make the service available to all the organizations.
```
cf enable-service-access mac-mysql
```

Set MySQL credentials as environment variables to the broker application.
```
cf set-env cf-mysql-node-broker host yourmysqlhost
cf set-env cf-mysql-node-broker port yourmysqlport
cf set-env cf-mysql-node-broker user 3306
cf set-env cf-mysql-node-broker password rootpassword
```

Restart the broker application to enable those environment variables.
```
cf restart cf-mysql-node-broker
```

You are now able to create MySQL schema and bind users to your applications.
